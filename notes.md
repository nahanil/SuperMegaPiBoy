## Cartridge SD Card adapter

The idea here is that a USB SD card reader will be fitted inside of a game cartridge, which in turn connects as a USB device
via a modified cartridge slot which is configured to act as a USB port connected to the Pi via a USB hub.

### Why not use the Pi's built in SD card reader?
The SD card reader built into the Pi will be used for the main OS & system files and not readily accessible to the user
without taking the SuperMegaPiBoy apart. The reasoning for adding an additional SD card reader is that games/other files can be stored on this second SD card and easily accessed from other devices.

Also nostalgia++ - no SD cartridge, no play.

### What will happen if this cartridge ends up in a GameBoy?
The GameBoy, cartridge or both devices will probably explode.. Maybe nothing will happen... Who knows?
